    <h1>What We Do</h1>

            <p class="aboutSection">Many people order a set of 4 tires even when just one needs to be replaced. However, the
                problem arises that while they are waiting for their set of 
                tires to be delivered and/or
                installed, they may feel unsafe driving on the worn tire. 
                This is where Tires in Time comes in. At Tires in Time, we allow 
                customers select and rent a tire they want while their personal set
                comes in. This allows you to feel safe while waiting on your new set to come in. 
                We rent out tires based on either a flat rate for one whole week, or a price per mile rate. 
                Using these two options, you can choose if you would rather 
                rent out a tire for one whole week, or if you don't
                plan to travel far on the rental tire, you can choose the price per mile plan.
