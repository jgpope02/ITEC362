            <p>Many people order a set of 4 tires even when just one needs to be replaced. However, the
                problem arises that while they are waiting for their set of 
                <br>tires to be delivered and/or
                installed, they may feel unsafe driving on the worn tire. 
                This is where Tires in Time comes in.At Tires in Time, we allow 
                <br>customers select and rent a tire they want while their personal set
                comes in. This allows you to feel safe while waiting on your new set to come in. 
                <br>We rent out tires based on either a flat rate for one whole week, or a price per mile rate. 
                Using these two options, you can choose if you would rather 
                <br>rent out a tire for one whole week, or if you don't
                plan to travel far on the rental tire, you can choose the price per mile plan.
